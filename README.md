# Elders Share Experience (ESE)
elders share experience

## Inspiration

The main motivation here is that to make elders who don't see their sons/daughters see anyone in the area who has time to spear with them and discuss with them about their life experiences.  Mostly older people seems abandoned and they barely see their descendant so this can help them get happier to meet new people and share with them stories of their interest.

## What it does
Older people make themselves available for people who are in the area to discuss about their experiences. They can choose keywords they like to discuss about. Lets say it can be stories from jobs back in their time, experiences they learned so hard and so on to tell anyone who is available on that time to discuss with.

## How I built it
Using Facebook API, Node.js, React.js.


## What's next for Elders Share Experience
To build a mobile app and market it, so more people can access it. And develop it to make it more user friendly.
